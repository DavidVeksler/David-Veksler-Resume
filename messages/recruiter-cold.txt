Experienced Software Engineering Leader Open to New Opportunities


Hi 

I hope this message finds you well. I'm David Veksler, a Software Engineering Leader with over 19 years of experience in driving technological advancements and team excellence in high-growth environments. My expertise spans engineering leadership, cloud and blockchain technologies, agile transformation, and full-stack development.

In my current role as Senior Software Engineering Manager at Celsius, I've led international development teams, launched successful blockchain projects, and implemented DeFi strategies. Previously, as CTO at Royalty Exchange, I orchestrated major platform migrations and launched innovative NFT products.

I'm always open to discussing exciting opportunities that align with my experience in fintech, blockchain, and engineering leadership. If you have any roles that might be a good fit, I'd be happy to connect.

Thanks,
David
